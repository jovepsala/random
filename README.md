# randomz - example application

This example implements an application that returns random integers through an exposed RPC method. The example implements an active tile. The mechanism in the tile calls the RPC method every five seconds and outputs the result to the tile. As a bonus feature this example also implements an application web page. Clicking the tile opens the web page into a new tab or window. See http://spaceify.org/wiki/doku.php?id=examples:application for more inforrmation.
